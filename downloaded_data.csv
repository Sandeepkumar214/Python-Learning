The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.\n[More Information][1]\n\n\n# Content\n\nGeography: Worldwide\n\nTime period: 1970-2017, *except 1993*\n\nUnit of analysis: Attack\n\nVariables: &gt;100 variables on location, tactics, perpetrators, targets, and outcomes\n\nSources: Unclassified media articles (Note: Please interpret changes over time with caution. Global patterns are driven by diverse trends in particular regions, and data collection is influenced by fluctuations in access to media coverage over both time and place.)\n\nDefinition of terrorism:\n\n\"The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation.\"\n\nSee the [GTD Codebook][2] for important details on data collection methodology, definitions, and coding schema.\n\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThe Global Terrorism Database is funded through START, by the US Department of State (Contract Number: SAQMMA12M1292) and the US Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate’s Office of University Programs (Award Number 2012-ST-061-CS0001, CSTAB 3.1). The coding decisions and classifications contained in the database are determined independently by START researchers and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official views or policies of the United States Government.\n\n[GTD Team][3]\n\n#Publications\n\nThe GTD has been leveraged extensively in [scholarly publications][4], [reports][5], and [media articles][6]. *[Putting Terrorism in Context: Lessons from the Global Terrorism Database][7]*, by GTD principal investigators LaFree, Dugan, and Miller investigates patterns of terrorism and provides perspective on the challenges of data collection and analysis. The GTD's data collection manager, Michael Jensen, discusses important [Benefits and Drawbacks of Methodological Advancements in Data Collection and Coding][8].\n\n\n# Terms of Use\n\nUse of the data signifies your agreement to the following [terms and conditions][9].\n\nEND USER LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND\n\nIMPORTANT – THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU (\"You\") AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, a public agency and instrumentality of the State of Maryland, by and through the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (“START,” “US,” “WE” or “University”).
